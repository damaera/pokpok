// Pokemon Detail page; should show a picture of the Pokemon with its moves
// and types (this information is from the API, feel free to add more information
// on the Pokemon if you want to). The mandatory thing is that there should be
// a button to catch the Pokemon, (success probability is 50%), if success then
// the user can give the Pokemon a nickname and add that Pokemon to `My
// Pokemon Listâ€™. You can catch the same pokemon multiple times but need to
// give a different nickname for each pokemon.
